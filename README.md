<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

This project was designed to help a survivor in their day to day operations of their ARK store. HLN-A assists users in order transactions, and has an array of moderation and wiki related commands for all things ARK!! The perfect companion to help any new survivors get all their information in the palm of their hand.

Here's what the bot features:
* Commands like: craft, and clone calculator, ~~reminders~~, ~~order/transaction tracking(shop management for owners)~~, server statuses, and more!
* Moderation commands such as: kick and ban, as well as mute(manual ~~and timed~~) and sweep(bulk delete messages).
* Customisable from prefix to bot command restrictions(applies to the channel), HLN-A can also set and deploy custom welcome messages
* Fast responses, great uptime, and support for the bot almost 24/7.

Of course, no one application is going to be perfect, issues will arise and in turn should be reported so that they can be fixed later. Be sure to check out the bots documentation to see how to set it up successfully for your Discord server, as well as get additional command information!
